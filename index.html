    <h1>To the One Who Holds My Heart,</h1>
    <p>
        Every beat of my heart whispers your name.<br>
        Every breath I take feels warmer with thoughts of you.<br><br>

        You are the sun in my sky, the calm in my storm, and the peace in my chaos.<br>
        When I look into your eyes, I see a future I never imagined until you came into my life.<br><br>

        I fall for you not just once, but every single day — with your smile, your voice, your soul.<br>
        You've painted my world with colors I never knew existed.<br><br>

        I love you not for how perfect you are, but for how perfect you make me feel.<br>
        I am yours, completely — in every way, in every moment, forever and always.
    </p>
    <p>
        With all my heart,<br>
        <strong>[Your future husband prince]</strong>
    </p>
